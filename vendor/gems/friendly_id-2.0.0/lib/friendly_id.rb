    # Options:
    # * <tt>:use_slug</tt> - Defaults to false. Use slugs when you want to use a non-unique text field for friendly ids.
    # * <tt>:max_length</tt> - Defaults to 255. The maximum allowed length for a slug.
    # * <tt>:strip_diacritics</tt> - Defaults to false. If true, it will remove accents, umlauts, etc. from western characters.
    # * <tt>:reseved</tt> - Array of words that are reserved and can't be used as slugs. If such a word is used, it will be treated the same as if that slug was already taken (numeric extension will be appended). Defaults to [].
