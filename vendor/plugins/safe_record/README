= Safe Record

== Overview

Safe Record is a Rails plugin to detect potential SQL injection
vulnerabilities with the taint mechanism of Ruby.  It will raise an
exception when a tainted string is passed as SQL.

Safe Record is experimental, so do NOT use in a production environment.

== Example

  # raises an exception!!
  post = Post.find(:first,
    :conditions => "title = '#{params[:title]}'")

  # OK :)
  post = Post.find(:first,
    :conditions => [
      "title = ?",
      params[:title]
    ])

  # Good :)
  post = Post.find_by_title(params[:title])
