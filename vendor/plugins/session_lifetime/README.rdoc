= SessionLifetime

SessionLifetime is a plugin which allows you to set a lifetime on your session. You can set it to expire the session 1 hour after the last activity.
Note: you must also set the cookie expiration time using the Rails 'session' function, as the default is reset session on browser close.

== Example
  class ApplicationController << ActionController::Base
    session :session_expires_after => 1.year
    expires_session :time => 90.days
    
    private
    def on_session_create
      # welcome flash, database setup etc.
    end

    def on_session_expiry
      # flash, database cleanup etc.
    end
  end
  
Or you can give some options:
* :time - After how much time of inactivity should the session be invalidated. Default is 1 hour
* :redirect_to - Where should we redirect the user to once their session has expired
* :on_session_create - Takes a Proc or a lamba which gives you a callback after the session creation. This is useful for setting a flash message or something in the database which must be set for every session.
* :on_session_expiry - Takes a Proc or a lamba which gives you a callback after the session invalidation. This is useful for setting a flash message or something in the database.

  class ApplicationController << ActionController::Base
    expires_session :time => 2.hours, :redirect_to => '/login', :on_session_expiry => lambda {
      flash[:notice] = "Your session has been expired, and you have been logged out."
    }
  end

If you want a controller not to have expiring_session you can use +skip_before_filter+:
  class SessionController << ApplicationController
    skip_before_filter :check_session_lifetime, :only => [:new, :create]
  end

== Missing something?
I wrote this plugin to solve the problems I had with default Rails session handling. If you have an additional need which you think would be great for this plugin, give me a shout at sessionlifetime@defv.be, or through GitHub, and I'll be more then happy to implement your proposal.
